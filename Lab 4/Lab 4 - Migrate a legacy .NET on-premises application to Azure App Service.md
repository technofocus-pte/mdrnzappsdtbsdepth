# Lab 4 - Migrate a legacy .NET on-premises application to Azure App Service

## Objective

In this lab, you will learn how to migrate an existing on-premises .NET
To-Do List application to Azure App Service using the **App Service
Migration Assistant** tool. You will analyze the on-prem application for
Azure compatibility, provision the necessary Azure resources, and
perform the migration directly from the local environment to the cloud.
By the end of the lab, you will understand how to use App Service
Migration Assistant to modernize legacy .NET applications and host them
in a fully managed Azure platform.

## Exercise 1 – Set up the environment

In this exercise, you will set up the pre-requisites required for
executing this lab

1.  Open **PowerShell** in **Administrator** mode from your system and
    execute the below command to install IIS in your system
    ```
    dism /online /enable-feature /featurename:IIS-WebServer /all /norestart 
    ```
    ```
    dism /online /enable-feature /featurename:IIS-ManagementConsole /all /norestart
    ```

    [MigrationId] [nvarchar](150) NOT NULL, 
    
    [ContextKey] [nvarchar](300) NOT NULL, 
    
    [Model] [varbinary](max) NOT NULL, 
    
    [ProductVersion] [nvarchar](32) NOT NULL, 
    
     CONSTRAINT [PK_dbo.__MigrationHistory] PRIMARY KEY CLUSTERED  
    
    ( 
    
        [MigrationId] ASC, 
        
        [ContextKey] ASC 
    
    )WITH (PAD_INDEX = OFF, STATISTICS_NORECOMPUTE = OFF, IGNORE_DUP_KEY = OFF, ALLOW_ROW_LOCKS = ON, ALLOW_PAGE_LOCKS = ON, OPTIMIZE_FOR_SEQUENTIAL_KEY = OFF) ON [PRIMARY]

16. Similar to the last step, execute the below query.

    ```
    USE [DotNetAppSqlDb] 
    GO 
    SET ANSI_NULLS ON 
    
    GO 
    SET QUOTED_IDENTIFIER ON 
    GO 
    
    CREATE TABLE [dbo].[Todoes]( 
    
    [ID] [int] IDENTITY(1,1) NOT NULL, 
    
    [Description] [nvarchar](max) NULL,

    target folder would have got populated with the app related data.

19. Open **Web.config** file from **C:\Labfiles\dotnetwebapp** and
    replace the content under the tag **Connection String** (in the Line
    number 12) as below, after replacing the ":Server Name" with the
    Server name value you saved from the Azure earlier.

    ```
    <add name="MyDbConnection"  

         connectionString="Server=tcp:<Server Name>,1433;Database=DotNetAppSqlDb;User
    ID=tgsqlserveradmin;Password=sqlPwd981!2@98;Encrypt=True;TrustServerCertificate=False;Connection Timeout=30;MultipleActiveResultSets=True;"  

         providerName="System.Data.SqlClient" /> 

    ```

## Exercise 5 - Migrate to Azure

In this exercise, you will migrate the app that is available on the IIS
Server to Azure App Service. You have the Migration Assistant tool on
your VM and you can start to assess and migrate the application.

1.  Open the App Service Migration Assistant. The tool will show you the
    websites that are running in IIS.

    ![A screenshot of a computer AI-generated content may be
    incorrect.](./media/image53.png)

2.  From the list of available sites, choose **dotnetwebapp** and click
    **Next**.

    ![A screenshot of a computer AI-generated content may be
    incorrect.](./media/image54.png)

3.  The tool will now assess the application to see if it can run in
    Azure and if anything needs to be changed. This will result in
    an **Assessment Report** like in the image below.

    ![A screenshot of a computer AI-generated content may be

3.  Enter the below details and select **Migrate**.

    - Resource Group – Select **Use existing** and select
    **ResourceGroup1**.

    - Destination Site Name - +++**todoitemswa@lab.LabInstance.Id**+++

    - App Service Plan – Select **Create New**

    - Region – Select your nearest region

    ![A screenshot of a computer AI-generated content may be
    incorrect.](./media/image60.png)

4.  From the Migration Results page, select **Go to your website link**.

    ![A screenshot of a computer AI-generated content may be
    incorrect.](./media/image61.png)

5.  This opens the app from the Azure website.

    ![A screenshot of a computer AI-generated content may be

6.  Go to the Azure portal and check the resources that are created
    under the **ResourceGroup1** Resource group.

## Summary

This lab demonstrated how to migrate a To-Do List .NET application from
an on-premises environment to Azure App Service with the **App Service
Migration Assistant**. You assessed the application’s readiness for
Azure, created the required App Service resources, and executed the
migration process. Finally, you validated the application running in the
cloud. Through this exercise, you gained practical experience with a
streamlined migration approach that leverages Azure App Service’s
scalability, monitoring, and simplified management to bring traditional
web applications into the cloud.
