### Lab 3 - Migrate on-premise PostgreSQL to Azure Database for PostgreSQL flexible server

### Time Duration – 60 mins

## Scenario

Terra Firm Laboratories is a global bioengineering company that’s the
leading researcher and innovator in genetic and biological science
technology. The company was founded in 1975 with its corporate
headquarters in Palo Alto, CA. Their mission-critical workloads are
currently hosted in an on-premises datacenter and are beginning a
journey to modernize and migrate into the cloud using Microsoft Azure.

The CTO, Dennis Nedry, has kicked off an initiative for the organization
to begin adopting the Microsoft Azure cloud and modernize its
infrastructure. He has already had his team begin assessing their
current environment and what it will take to migrate to the cloud. They
are looking to optimize their technology investments by reducing
technical debt and streamlining operations using Azure
Infrastructure-as-a-Service (IaaS) and Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS)
cloud services.

Terra Firm Laboratories has already completed the first round of
analysis to identify the applications and workloads to begin migrating
first. Out of over 250 workloads they have running on-premises, they
have identified one workload that exemplifies multiple components common
across many of their other workloads. They decided to use a simpler
workload that will still assist in proving out the migration plan as
it’s developed. This workload includes a web-based order system written
in PHP that is running on Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) servers
connecting to a PostgreSQL database on-premises.

This lab will cover the database migration part alone. In this lab,
attendees will perform the migration of the on-premises database to an
Azure Database for PostgreSQL Flexible Server - a managed database
service.

## Solution Architecture

![Diagram showing the proposed solution
architecture](./media/image1.png)

In this lab we are going to:

- Provisioning a Linux Server VM

- Set up a Linux Server for application migration to Azure

- Migrate an on-premises PostgreSQL Database to Azure Database for
  PostgreSQL - Flexible Server

# Exercise 1 - Lab Setup

In this exercise, you will perform steps toward migrating Terra Firm
Laboratories on-premises Linux Servers and PostgreSQL workloads to
Azure. Terra Firm Laboratories needs a new Linux Server VM created in
Azure for hosting their Web application, an on-premises PostgreSQL
database migrated to Azure PostgreSQL PaaS, a secure Linux Server, and
an on-premises Linux Server VM to be Azure Arc-enabled. Terra Firm
Laboratories already has a Hub and Spoke network setup in Azure with
Azure Bastion for enabling secure remote management of Azure VMs using
Azure Bastion. The Azure resources provisioned throughout this lab will
be deployed into this environment.

### Objectives

After completing this exercise, you will be able to:

- Deploy ARM Template

- Verify the on-premises web application

## Task 1 – Create resources

In this task, you will leverage a custom Azure Resource Manager (ARM)
template to deploy the Azure resources and create a simulated
on-premises environment for Terra Firm Laboratories.

1.  Open a browser and navigate to +++https://portal.azure.com/+++. Now,
    sign in with your cloud slice account:

    - Username - +++@lab.CloudPortalCredential(User1).Username+++
    - TAP Token - +++@lab.CloudPortalCredential(User1).AccessToken+++

    ![](./media/image2.png)
    ![](./media/image3.png)
    ![](./media/image4.png)
    ![](./media/image5.png)

2.  Open a new tab in the browser, and navigate to the following link to
    get the ARM template: 

    +++https://github.com/technofocus-pte/MigrateLinuxworkloads/tree/main/resources/deployment+++

3.  Select **Deploy to Azure**. This will open a new browser tab to the
    Azure Portal for custom deployments.
    
    ![The GitHub page with Deploy to
    Azure button highlighted.](./media/image6.png)

4.  Fill in the required ARM template parameters.

    - **Subscription:** Use the default one

    - **Resource group:** Select **ResourceGroup1**

    - **Region:** @lab.CloudResourceGroup(ResourceGroup1).Location

    - **Resource Name Base:** Enter +++terrafirm@lab.LabInstance.Id+++

    - **Password:** Enter +++pass@dmIn234+++

    Select **Review + create**

    ![A screenshot of a computer AI-generated content may be
    incorrect.](./media/image7.png)

5.  Click on the **Create** button to start deployment.

    ![](./media/image8.png)

6.  The deployment is now underway. On average, this process can take
    10-20 minutes to complete.

    ![A screenshot of a computer AI-generated content may be
    incorrect.](./media/image9.png)

    **Note**: While automation can make things simpler and repeatable,
    sometimes it can fail. If at any time during the ARM template deployment
    there is a failure, review the failure, delete the Resource Group, and
    try the ARM template again. Or review the failures and adjust for errors
    as appropriate.

7.  Once the ARM template is deployed successfully, the status will
    change to complete. Click on **Go to resource group** to open the
    resource group.

    ![](./media/image10.png)

# Task 02 - Configure on-premises web application

In this task, you will configure the web application hosted on the
simulated on-premises APP virtual machine that was provisioned by the
ARM Template deployment.

1.  Select the **On-premises Workload VM** named similar
    to **terrafirm@lab.LabInstance.Id-onprem-workload-vm**.

    ![](./media/image11.png)

2.  In the **Overview** page, go to **Properties**, and under the
    **Networking** section, locate the **Private IP Address** of the VM
    and copy it into Notepad.

    **Note:** You will need this IP address to configure the web application
    to use the database workload server.

    ![](./media/image12.png)

3.  Navigate back to the **ResourceGroup1**, then select
    the **On-premises APP VM** named similar
    to **terrafirm@lab.LabInstance.Id-onprem-app-vm**.

    ![A screenshot of a computer AI-generated content may be

4.  Search for +++**Bastion**+++ in the left-hand menu and then select
    **Bastion**. We will use a bastion host as the method to connect to
    our VMs, as this is a more secure method.

    ![A screenshot of a computer AI-generated content may be
    incorrect.](./media/image14.png)

5.  Within the **Bastion** page, enter the following details:

    - **Authentication Type:** VM Password

    - **Username:** Enter +++demouser+++

    - **VM Password:** Enter +++pass@dmIn234+++

    Then click on the **Connect** button to connect with Bastion.

    ![A screenshot of a computer AI-generated content may be
    incorrect.](./media/image15.png)

    **Note**: You may need to **allow pop-ups** if they are blocked in
    your browser.

6.  When connected to the VM via the Bastion host, you will get a screen
    like this:

    ![](./media/image16.png)

    **Note**: If you see a pop-up stating “See test and images copied to the
    clipboard”. Click **Allow**.

7.  Once connected via Bastion, enter the following command to install
    the git utility on the server.

    +++sudo yum install git -y+++

    ![A screenshot of a computer AI-generated content may be
    incorrect.](./media/image17.png)

8.  Enter the following command to clone the remote git repository
    holding a script which will configure the web app on the application
    server.

    +++sudo git clone https://github.com/technofocus-pte/TechExcel-Migrate-Linux-workloads.git+++

    ![](./media/image18.png)

9.  You can now run the configuration script by using the following
    command:

    +++sudo bash TechExcel-Migrate-Linux-workloads/resources/deployment/onprem/APP-workload-install.sh+++

    ![](./media/image19.png)
    
    You will get a status message of  “The script as successful”.

    ![](./media/image20.png)

11. Execute the following command to open the **orders.php** file for
    the web application in a text editor. The application needs to be
    configured to connect to the **Azure Database for PostgreSQL Flexible Server** database.

    +++sudo nano /var/www/html/orders.php+++

    ![](./media/image21.png)

    ![](./media/image22.png)

12. Use the **down arrow** key to scroll down in the order.php file
    until you locate $host, $port, $dbname, $user, and $password.  
    
    ![](./media/image23.png)

13. Check the host IP address and configure it to match the **Private IP
    Address** of the **terrafirm@lab.LabInstance.Id-onprem-workload-vm** instance. If the host IP is already correct, skip to steps 13 and 14. And press **Ctrl+X** to exit the editor.

    ![](./media/image24.png)

14. If the host IP is not the same, then replace it with the **Private
    IP Address** of the **terrafirm-onprem-workload-vm** instance that
    was copied in step 2. Then press **Ctrl+X**.

    ![](./media/image25.png)

15. Press +++**Y**+++ to save the modified buffer and then press
    **Enter** to write the changes in the file.

    ![](./media/image26.png)

    ![](./media/image27.png)

16. You are now exited from the orders.php file with the changes saved.

    ![](./media/image28.png)

    You have now learnt some basic Linux commands and configured the web
    application to use the database on an internal network rather than
    across the internet.

# Task 03 - Validate on-premises web application

In this task, you will validate the web application hosted on the
simulated on-premises APP virtual machine that was provisioned by the
ARM Template deployment.

1.  Navigate back to Azure Portal, open the ResourceGroup1, then select
    the **On-premises APP VM** named similar
    to **terrafirm@lab.LabInstance.Id-onprem-app-vm**.

    ![](./media/image29.png)

2.  In the **Overview** window, go to **Properties**. Under the
    **Networking** section, locate the VM’s **Public IP Address** and
    copy it into Notepad.

    ![](./media/image30.png)

3.  Open a new browser window, then navigate to the
    following **http:// URL** to access the simulated on-premises web
    application provisioned for this lab. Be sure to replace
    the **ip-address** placeholder with the Public IP Address for
    the VM. For example: http://172.206.126.43

    +++http://ip-address+++

    **Note:** You should get the Red Hat Enterprise Linux Test Page 

    ![](./media/image31.png)

4.  When the web page loads, enter the following at the end of the URL.
    For example: "http://172.206.126.43/orders.php"

    +++http://ip-address/orders.php+++  
    
    ![A screenshot of a computer AI-generated content may be
